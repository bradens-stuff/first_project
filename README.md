# My first C project

I wrote this whe I was first learning C. Note the use of shell scripts instead of a proper `Makefile`

To compile
-
    $ ./install

I commented out the parts that move the binary to `/usr/bin` because there should be a way to compile without doing that

To run
-

    $ ./firstproj

And just go from there
